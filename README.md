The official version [Earth View from Google Earth](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh) based on Object.observe, and it stopped working in the latest update to Canary.

In November Object.observe proposal was withdrawn from TC39.

Although it may still work in old Chrome browsers, but it had removed at Chrome Canary version 51.0.2668.0 canary (64-bit). So I add Object.observe polyfill for it.
